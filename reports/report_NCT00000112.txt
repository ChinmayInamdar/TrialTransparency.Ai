Clinical Trial Title: Prevalence of Carbohydrate Intolerance in Lean and Obese Children

Brief Summary: The prevalence of obesity in children is reaching epidemic proportions. Excess adiposity
is more than just a cosmetic problem, having substantial metabolic consequences. Insulin
resistance, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and frank diabetes are often
seen in obese children. In this study the prevalence of impaired glucose (carbohydrate)
tolerance in lean children with a family history of diabetes and obese children with
acanthosis nigricans with or without a family history of diabetes mellitus will be
studied.
