Clinical Trial Title: Influence of Diet and Endurance Running on Intramuscular Lipids Measured at 4.1 TESLA

Brief Summary: The purpose of this pilot investigation is to use 1 H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
(MRS) to 1) document the change in intra-muscular lipid stores (IML) before and after a
prolonged bout of endurance running and, 2) determine the pattern (time course) of IML
replenishment following an extremely low-fat diet (10% of energy from fat) and a
moderate-fat diet (35% of energy from fat). Specifically, the study will evaluate the
change in IML following a 2-hour training run and the recovery of IML in response to the
post-exercise low-fat or moderate-fat diet in 10 endurance trained athletes who will
consume both diets in a randomly assigned cross-over fashion. We hypothesize that IML
will be depleted with prolonged endurance exercise, and that replenishment of IML will be
impaired by an extremely low-fat diet compared to a moderate-fat diet. Results of this
pilot study will be used to apply for extramural grant support from NIH or the US Armed
Forces to investigate the effect of dietary fat on the health and performance of
individuals performing heavy physical training. It is anticipated that this methodology
could also be employed in obesity research to delineate, longitudinally, the reported
cross-sectional relationships among IML stores, insulin resistance and obesity.
