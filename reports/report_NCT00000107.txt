Clinical Trial Title: Body Water Content in Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease

Brief Summary: Adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease have elevated levels of plasma proatrial
natruretic peptide (proANP) which most likely results in chronic dehydration, leading to
reduced oxygen transport to tissues and shortness of breath with activity. The purpose of
this study is to characterize adults with cyanotic congenital heart defects with respect
to their body composition (water and fat-free mass) and resting metabolic rates. The
study consists of several measures of how much body water, fat and lean tissue a subject
has, and measures the number of calories the subject's body uses at rest. Adult subjects
with cyanotic congenital heart disease will be recruited along with healthy noncyanotic
control subjects matched for age, gender, and body weight.
