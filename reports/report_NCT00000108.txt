Clinical Trial Title: Effects of Training Intensity on the CHD Risk Factors in Postmenopausal Women

Brief Summary: The purpose of this research is to find out whether training at different exercise
intensities reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) to a different
extent. Heart attacks and stroke are the leading cause of death in older women. Reduced
variability of the heart rate and increased dips and swings in blood pressure are risks
factors that predict the chance of developing CVD as are increased levels of clotting
protein fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and high levels of
LDL-cholesterol (>160mg/dl). We will be measuring all of these risk factors and any
changes in your body fat level before you start training and after 15 and 30 weeks of
training in the form of walking. At the present time the effects of exercise intensity on
these factors are not well understood. This study will add to the basic understanding of
these issues and allow us to recommend to postmenopausal women optimal exercise
intensities to lose body fat and reduce the risk of developing CVD.
